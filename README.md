Personal website

![Personal portfolio website](./img/website-screenshot.PNG)

This is my portfolio website used to display accomplishments, projects, activities, and employment. It is available 
at www.wyatttauber.com. I used the startboostrap-bare template by [David Miller](http://davidmiller.io/) at 
[Blackrock Digital](http://blackrockdigital.io/) to make this site.
